      <ul>
        <li>Scarlet Witch is a being of <strong>Primordial Chaos</strong>, wielding magic that rewrites reality itself. She has defeated cosmic beings, altered timelines, and undone existence with a whisper — “No more mutants.”</li>
        <li>Her feats include overpowering the Phoenix Force, destroying the Darkhold across universes, and being labeled a Nexus Being — a constant across realities. Her power surpasses even Sorcerer Supreme levels.</li>
        <li>From humble beginnings as a Sokovian experiment subject to one of the multiverse’s most formidable entities, Wanda’s growth is exponential and often uncontrollable, embodying chaos in its purest form.</li>
