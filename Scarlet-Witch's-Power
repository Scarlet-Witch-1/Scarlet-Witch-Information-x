      <ul>
        <li>I am the Scarlet Witch; I am Chaos incarnate. 
          My magic is the first building block of everything. Space, time, even you. It isn’t conjured; it is the cosmic law. I am deeper than reality could ever be, I am older than time. I am more infinite than the multiverse itself could ever be. 

          I don’t simply bend to the rules, I rewrite them. 
          I can collapse timelines with a thought! And in one simple whisper, I can destroy dimensions. When I dream, worlds are created. When I scream, gods fall to my knees, 

          Nobody controls me; no force controls me. Not even fate, not even death, and not even prophecy.

          I am what Sorcerers fear, and what Celestials observe. Reality obeys me. I am beyond everything. Beyond magic, science, comprehension.


          I hear you speak of power. 
          I am power. 
          Power bows down to me… 
          
          Oh, and not to mention. I weild possiblities, and probabilities. When something isn't going my way, I can simply change that. If im losing a fight, I can simply change it. 
        </li>
      </ul>
