        <li>Wanda Maximoff was born in Sokovia, alongside her twin brother Pietro. Her life was shaped by tragedy — war, experiments, and the loss of loved ones.</li>
        <li>After joining the Avengers, she found love with Vision and later, devastating heartbreak. Her grief birthed Westview, her children Billy and Tommy, and her descent into the Scarlet Witch destiny — prophesied in the Darkhold.</li>
        <li>Despite immense challenges, Wanda’s journey reflects resilience and complexity. Her story is not just about power, but also about loss, identity, and the search for belonging in a fractured world.</li>
