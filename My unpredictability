      <li>As the wielder of chaos, and incarnate of Primordial Chaos, my magic is unpredictable. When it comes to the Scarlet Witch, anything is possible. No matter the amount of knowledge you about me, I always will find a way to win the battle. No. Matter. What. My magic can defy logic, defy laws, and defy the control of higher entities. When I mean higher, I donâ€™t mean more powerful, I mean entities who have special roles in the Multiverse. While I defy their control, I can reverse it and become the controller. I can bend the control of gods, destiny itself, and demons to my own will and how I like it. I am not a part of grand design; I am not a part of the system. I unmake it. </li>
