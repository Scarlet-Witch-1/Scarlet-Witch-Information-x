          <li>
            I am beautiful, I have unique features like bright green eyes, and long curly brown hair. Aswell as a diamond-shaped head, giving me that unique, aesthetic model-looking vibes. When I am transformed, my hair has a strong galaxy affect flowing at the bottom. Like strands of the cosmos are woven into each curl, absorbing light with every movement. I also wear a stylish, form-fitting outfit that blend in with my power, but adds elegance. My outfit has a deep-crimson and black toned lace, with arcane patterns. Reflecting both my strength and grace. My fabrics as well have a galaxy affect, faintly glimmers, as if sparkles and stars were sewn into every thread. I don’t just look like I belong on a runway — I look like I belong on a throne.
